# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Docker-based development container configuration for running Claude Code CLI in a sandboxed environment. Network access is restricted by routing all traffic through an external `ai_filtering_proxy` container that enforces a domain allowlist. It is not an application codebase — it consists of configuration files only.

## Build and Run Commands

- `make docker-build` — Build the Docker image (`claude-code:latest`)
- `make claude-here` — Run Claude Code CLI in a container (mounts current directory, requires `ai_proxy_network_internal`)
- `make bash` — Open a bash shell in a new container (requires `ai_proxy_network_internal`)

Host-side Claude config is stored at `~/.docker-claude` and mounted into the container at `/home/node/claude-config`.

## Architecture

**Dockerfile**: Based on `node:20`. Installs Claude Code via npm globally, sets up a non-root `node` user, configures zsh with powerlevel10k, installs dev tools via apt and pinned binary releases (see Dockerfile for the current list), and runs `motd.sh` as a startup banner. The `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` build arg controls the CLI version. All binary downloads are pinned by version and verified with SHA-256 checksums at build time.

**Makefile**: Wrapper around `docker build` and `docker run`. Containers run as UID 1000:1000 (`node` user), are attached exclusively to `ai_proxy_network_internal`, and have `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` set to route through the proxy. Both targets verify the network exists before starting.

**claude-here**: Standalone shell script equivalent of `make claude-here`. Can be symlinked onto `PATH` to run Claude Code from any directory without `make` or the repo present.

**motd.sh**: Startup banner sourced by `.zshrc`/`.bashrc` on shell open. Shows installed vs. latest versions of claude-code and the anthropic Python package, proxy connectivity status, and a warning when running in unfiltered mode.

## Key Details

- The container's working directory is `/workspace`, but `make claude-here` mounts the host CWD to `/<dirname>`
- The container has no direct internet access — the `ai_filtering_proxy` container is the only egress path
- Shell history persists via a `/commandhistory` volume
- Python packages are installed globally via `pip3 install --break-system-packages` directly in the Dockerfile; add or remove packages there
- **Unfiltered mode**: passing `UNFILTERED=1` (via `claude-here --unfiltered`) attaches the container to the `bridge` network with all proxy env vars cleared, giving direct internet access. The startup banner displays a prominent warning in this mode.
